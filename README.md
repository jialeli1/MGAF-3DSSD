# MGAF-3DSSD
The official implementation of "[Anchor-free 3D Single Stage Detector with Mask-Guided Attention for Point Cloud](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03634.pdf)" in ACM MM 2021.

:loudspeaker: The code is released along with another paper "From Voxel to Point: IoU-guided 3D Object Detection for Point Cloud with Voxel-to-Point Decoder" ([FromVoxelToPoint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03648.pdf)). Please refer to this [repo](https://github.com/jialeli1/From-Voxel-to-Point.git).
